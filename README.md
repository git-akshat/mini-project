## Motivation

In our college library there is huge shortage of books. There are only 50% student who get books from library and others have to buy, so they spent a lot of money on books every year and those books won’t be much use to them next year which made us think of making an application through which we can sell our old books and also we can buy old books from seniors at less cost which will result in lot of money saving.
